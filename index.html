                            <p>  Being born and raised in the heart of it all, the great state of Ohio, many might expect that 
                                I am a die hard OSU fan and the assumption is correct. I like to think of myself as a secret 
                                supporter due to the burden of keeping up the guise. Frankly, I only care about football when I
                                am amongst my fellow buckeyes. I suspect that there are other out there. Some who feel that 
                                Brutus does not quite get how we feel. We are the forgotten ones. We bleed scarlet and gray
                                from dawn to the dying of the light. We are the ultimate spectators. No need for loudness. No need
                                for roodness. We simply exist, we live life, we watch football, we get excited on occasion.
                                We know that no matter what we are "Buckeyes". Wins and losses won't change my mood. It won't make
                                me depressed. No chaos required.
                            </p>
                           
                            
                        </div>
                            <p> Enter, Aspiring Web Developer Stage left. Yes, I know I have just refered to my self in
                                the third person, but that is how my brain works. My method of solving problems is to visualize 
                                the solution as a bag of cats waiting to be released. Wierd analogy, right? We have to release
                                the cats and let all the chaos out sometime before the underlying issue can be solved. You could
                                say that I am comfortable with a certain level of it and have found that once all the questions have
                                had their day in the sun the solution is obvious. In short, my name is Kourtney, I like to find
                                solutions in the chaos, while contributing to it as little as possible. I am usually successful at both.
